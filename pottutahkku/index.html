    <p>Nezuko Kamado is the younger sister of Tanjiro Kamado in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. 
        After a demon attack led by Muzan Kibutsuji, she is transformed into a demon but retains her human emotions 
        and a strong sense of empathy, especially towards humans, whom she actively protects rather than harms.<br>

Nezuko possesses unique abilities that set her apart from other demons. She can manipulate her physical form and age, allowing her to shrink or grow at will. 
Her Blood Demon Art, known as "Pyrokinesis"enables her to create and control special demonic flames with her blood.
 Notably, she can recover her strength through sleep alone, without consuming human blood.</p>
